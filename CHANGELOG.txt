Osclass 8.3.0
------------------------
- IMPORTANT: Osclass now fully supports PHP 8.3 & PHP 8.4 version.
- IMPORTANT: Many core osclass functions has been rewritten and optimized in order to reduce loops and unnecessary database queries.
  Osclass preload categories, cities, regions and countries to session and search directly here instead of doing extra DB calls (only if amount of data is acceptable).
  Massive optimization of functions and queries to preserve results in session & cache and reduce amount of database queries.
- IMPORTANT: Added brand new feature that allows users to filter items on their user items page & user public profile page.
  Majority of standard search parameters are supported.
  Comes with friendly canonical URL features.
  Set of new functions has been added into models, helpers and controllers to support this feature.
- IMPORTANT: Optimization of search URL and osc_search_url() function:
  Order column dt_pub_date will not be included in url anymore as it's default order column.
  Order type DESC will not be included in url anymore as it's default sort.
- IMPORTANT: Major feature "Custom search rules" has been added into Settings > Permalinks.
  It is now possible to create 26 custom search rules based on params those are active in search. 
  These rules can be strict or fuzzy - accepting also params not specified in rule settings.
  There is full support for plugin/theme custom parameters and custom field parameters (meta) as well.
  Custom search rules are fully compatible with subdomains.
  Custom rules has top priority above canonical rules. Rules are prioritized (Z - top priority, A - lowest priority)
  Examples:
    > {sCity}/{sCategory} -> /a/bremen/for-sale
    > {sRegion}/{sCity}/{sCategory} -> /b/alabama/bremen/for-sale
    > cat:{sCategory}/city:{sCity}/min-{sPriceMin}-eur -> /c/category:for-sale/city:bremen/min-55-eur
  Examples with fuzzy logic, where extra params are enabled:
    > {sCity}/{sCategory} with {sRegion} -> /a/bremen/for-sale/region,alabama
    > {sRegion}/{sCity} with {sCategory} and {sShowAs} -> /b/alabama/bremen/category,for-sale/view,grid
  This feature is for advanced users and improper setup can cause unexpected behaviour!
- IMPORTANT: Osclass now supports EMOJI! 
  This includes change in connection, database and table charset. All these are changed by Osclass upgrade, but read carefuly!
  Some tables those has foreign key to table t_locale cannot be automatically converted and must be done manually by user that is looking for Emoji support.
  These are for example pages, category and user description tables and keywords table (Item description is converted by Osclass).
  For new installations, everything is created in charset utf8mb4, collate utf8mb4_unicode_ci.
  In case your DB would not support this charset/collate, you must migrate to one that supports it!
- Canonical search URL as combination of category_city and category_region, that has been using underscore as delimiter, is now configurable via SEARCH_URL_CANONICAL_DELIMITER constant.
  Default value of SEARCH_URL_CANONICAL_DELIMITER has been changed to ":".
- Added option on search page to apply pattern in search without locale restriction.
  Means search works on all item title & descriptions no matter what is user locale.
- IMPORTANT: New interface to browse, search and manage logs has been added into Backoffice > Tools > Action logs.
  Note that Osclass was always collecting logs and if logs are collected or not and if logs are automatically cleaned or not, was never available in Osclass.
  Admin is now able to enable/disable logging in Settings > General, setup automatic cleanup by daily cron and define retention policy (ie remove logs after 24 months).
  It is possible to remove single log, cleanup all old logs (in Tools > Data Cleanup) and search in action logs.
  Logs were also enriched with comment and detail fields those will be populated in future, when needed.
  We strongly recommend to every admin, check your logs, update settings and drop old logs those are not required at all - it may lot of database space and optimize performance.
- IMPORTANT: Alerts - subscriptions major improvements.

  Added extra fields like params, sql and trigger count, in general more options and details in backoffice. 
  Improved trigerring of alerts, statistics capturing, search page url for alert, search title and more.

  print - to print summary of cron to see if everything was OK. Only available for logged-in admin.
  type - or cron-type - both params are OK to specify which type of cron to run. New type "all" is supported if force=1.
  Sample URL: https://yourpage.com/index.php?page=cron&type=daily&force=1&print=1
